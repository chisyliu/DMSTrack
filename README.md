We propose a novel algorithm: Differentiable Multi-Sensor Kalman Filter for 3D Multi-Object Cooperative Tracking (DMSTrack). Our algorithm is designed to be capable of estimating observation noise covariance of each detection from different CAVs to better take advantage of the Kalman Filterâ€™s theoretical optimality property: minimizing the expected error of state estimation.
